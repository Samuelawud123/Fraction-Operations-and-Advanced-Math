# Fraction Operations and Advanced Math

## Overview

This repository contains Java programs focused on performing various operations with fractions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it includes an extra credit section that explores mathematical concepts like exponentials and factorials.

## Coursework

These files are part of an assignment for a CSC 142 (Computer Programming 1) course. The main goals are to implement and manipulate fractions in Java, and to extend the functionality by calculating exponential series and factorials as part of the extra credit work.

## Files

1. **`FractionMain.java`**:
   - Provides a user interface to input fractions and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Includes the main workflow for interacting with fractions and displaying results.

2. **`Fraction.java`**:
   - Defines a `Fraction` class with methods to handle basic arithmetic operations on fractions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Includes methods to reduce fractions, adjust signs, and convert fractions to their decimal form.

3. **`ExtraCredit.java`**:
   - Calculates the exponential value for a series and computes factorials.
   - Demonstrates the use of loops and mathematical functions to solve advanced problems.

## Usage

- **Compile and Run**: Use a Java compiler to compile and run the programs. For example:
  ```bash
  javac FractionMain.java
  java FractionMain
